      HACK:
      VS Code currently doesn't support Roslyn generators (VS 16.6+ does, tho).
      In order to void seeing errors in VS Code and to get IntelliSense,
      we're doing a trick:
      1. The generator writes the file to disk, using the *.g.cs naming
         convention (borrowed from WPF).
      2. In MSBuild we're excluding those files
      Since VS Code's C# extension (or more specifically OmniSharp) doesn't
      resolve items from MSBuild, it will include the file while neither
      VS nor the CLI/CI build will.
      Also include the generated file in Rider, which retrieves items from
      MSBuild, but doesn't currently support generators.
